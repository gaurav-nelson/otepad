# Otepad

A minimal free temporary note-taking app for you - not your regular text editor.

- Works offline and saves all notes locally on your phone. Keep them till you want and delete them when you don't.
- Easily switch to a dark or light theme.
- No fancy features copy-paste things or type directly.
