    <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> <p>
                  Gaurav Nelson built the otepad app as
                  an Open Source app. This SERVICE is provided by
                  Gaurav Nelson at no cost and is intended for use as
                  is.
                </p> <p>
                  This page is used to inform visitors regarding my
                  policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
                  Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
                </p> <p>
                  If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to
                  the collection and use of information in relation to this
                  policy. The Personal Information that I collect is
                  used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with
                  anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
                </p> <p>
                  The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings
                  as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at
                  otepad unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
                </p> <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p> <p>
                  This application does not collect any data.
                </p> <p>
                  This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
                  the app may use third-party code and libraries that use
                  “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
                </p> <p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p> <!----> <div><p>
                    I do not knowingly collect personally
                    identifiable information from children. I 
                    encourage all children to never submit any personally
                    identifiable information through 
                    the Application and/or Services.
                    I encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor 
                    their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing 
                    their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child 
                    has provided personally identifiable information to us through the Application and/or Services, 
                    please contact us. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing 
                    of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent 
                    or guardian to do so on your behalf).
                  </p></div> <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p>
                  I may update our Privacy Policy from
                  time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
                  periodically for any changes. I will
                  notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on
                  this page.
                </p> <p>This policy is effective as of 2022-01-17</p> <p><strong>Contact Us</strong></p> <p>
